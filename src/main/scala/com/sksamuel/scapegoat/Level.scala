   * practice.
   *
   * An example is an expression as a statement. While this is perfectly legal, it could indicate that the
   * developer meant to assign the result to or otherwise use it.
   *
   * Another example is a constant if. You can do things like if (true) { } if you want, but since the block
   * will always evaluate, the if statement perhaps indicates a mistake.
