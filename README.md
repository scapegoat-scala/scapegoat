Scapegoat is a Scala static code analyzer, what is more colloquially known as a code lint tool or linter. Scapegoat works in a similar vein to Java's [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) or [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/), or Scala's [Scalastyle](https://github.com/scalastyle/scalastyle).

A static code analyzer is a tool that flag suspicious language usage in code. This can include behavior likely to lead or bugs, non idiomatic usage of a language, or just code that doesn't conform to specified style guidelines.

**What's the difference between this project and Scalastyle (or others)?**

Scalastyle is a similar linting tool which focuses mostly on enforcing style/code standards. There's no problems running multiple analysis tools on the same codebase. In fact it could be beneficial as the total set of possible warnings is the union of the inspections of all the enabled tools. The worst case is that the same warnings might be generated by multiple tools.

### Usage
Scapegoat is developed as a scala compiler plugin, which can then be used inside your build tool.

#### SBT
See: [sbt-scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/sbt-scapegoat) for SBT integration.

#### Maven

Firstly you need to add scapegoat plugin as a dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sksamuel.scapegoat</groupId>
    <artifactId>scalac-scapegoat-plugin_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Then configure `scala-maven-plugin` by adding `compilerPlugin`

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>net.alchim31.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>scala-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <args>
            <arg>-P:scapegoat:dataDir:./target/scapegoat</arg>
        </args>
        <compilerPlugins>
            <compilerPlugin>
                <groupId>com.sksamuel.scapegoat</groupId>
                <artifactId>scalac-scapegoat-plugin_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>
                <version>1.3.3</version>
            </compilerPlugin>
        </compilerPlugins>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```
The only required parameter is `dataDir` (where report will be generated):

`<arg>-P:scapegoat:dataDir:./target/scapegoat</arg>`

You can pass other configuration flags same way, e.g.

`<arg>-P:scapegoat:disabledInspections:FinalModifierOnCaseClass</arg>`

Note: You may use a separate maven profile, so that the dependency doesn't go to you runtime classpath.

#### Gradle

Firstly you need to add scapegoat plugin as a dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.sksamuel.scapegoat:scalac-scapegoat-plugin_2.12:1.3.3'
  scalaCompilerPlugin "com.sksamuel.scapegoat:scalac-scapegoat-plugin_2.12:1.3.3"
}

```

Then configure `scala-compiler-plugin` 

```groovy
configurations {
  scalaCompilerPlugin
}

tasks.withType(ScalaCompile) {
  scalaCompileOptions.additionalParameters = [
    "-Xplugin:" + configurations.scalaCompilerPlugin.asPath,
    "-P:scapegoat:dataDir:" + buildDir + "/scapegoat"
  ]
}

```

The only required parameter is `dataDir` (where report will be generated):

`"-P:scapegoat:dataDir:" + buildDir + "/scapegoat",`

You can pass other configuration flags adding it to the `additionalParameters` list, e.g.

`"-P:scapegoat:disabledInspections:FinalModifierOnCaseClass""`


### Reports

Here is sample output from the console during the build for a project with warnings/errors:

```
[warning] [scapegoat] Unused method parameter - org.ensime.util.ClassIterator.scala:46
[warning] [scapegoat] Unused method parameter - org.ensime.util.ClassIterator.scala:137
[warning] [scapegoat] Use of var - org.ensime.util.ClassIterator.scala:22
[warning] [scapegoat] Use of var - org.ensime.util.ClassIterator.scala:157
[   info] [scapegoat]: Inspecting compilation unit [FileUtil.scala]
[warning] [scapegoat] Empty if statement - org.ensime.util.FileUtil.scala:157
[warning] [scapegoat] Expression as statement - org.ensime.util.FileUtil.scala:180

```

And if you prefer a prettier report, here is a screen shot of the type of HTML report scapegoat generates:

##### Arrays to string

Checks for explicit toString calls on arrays. Since toString on an array does not perform a deep toString, like say scala's List, this is usually a mistake.

##### CollectionIndexOnNonIndexedSeq

Checks for calls of `.apply(idx)` on a `Seq` where the index is not a literal and the `Seq` is not an `IndexedSeq`.

*Rationale* If code which expects O(1) positional access to a Seq is given a non-IndexedSeq (such as a List, where indexing is O(n)) then this may cause poor performance.

##### ComparingUnrelatedTypes

Checks for equality comparisons that cannot succeed because the types are unrelated. Eg `"string" == BigDecimal(1.0)`. The scala compiler has a less strict version of this inspection.

##### ConstantIf

Checks for if statements where the condition is always true or false. Not only checks for the boolean literals, but also any expression that the compiler is able to turn into a constant value. Eg, `if (0 < 1) then else that`

##### IllegalFormatString

Checks for a format string that is not invalid, such as invalid conversions, invalid flags, etc. Eg, `"% s"`, `"%qs"`, `%.-4f"`

##### IncorrectNumberOfArgsToFormat

Checks for an incorrect number of arguments to String.format. Eg, `"%s %s %f".format("need", "three")` flags an error because the format string specifies 3 parameters but the call only provides 2.

##### InvalidRegex

Checks for invalid regex literals that would fail at compile time. Either dangling metacharacters, or unclosed escape characters, etc that kind of thing.

##### List size

Checks for .size on an instance of List. Eg, `val a = List(1,2,3); a.size`

*Rationale* List.size is O(n) so for performance reasons if .size is needed on a list that could be large, consider using an alternative with O(1), eg Array, Vector or ListBuffer.

##### Redundant finalizer

Checks for empty finalizers. This is redundant code and should be removed. Eg, `override def finalize : Unit = { }`

##### PreferSetEmpty

Indicates where code using Set() could be replaced with Set.empty. Set() instantiates a new instance each time it is invoked, whereas Set.empty returns a pre-instantiated instance.

##### UnnecessaryReturnUse

Checks for use of return in a function or method. Since the final expression of a block is always the return value, using return is unnecessary. Eg, `def foo = { println("hello"); return 12; }`

##### UnreachableCatch

Checks for catch clauses that cannot be reached. This means the exception is dead and if you want that exception to take precedence you should move up further up the case list.

##### UnsafeContains

Checks for `List.contains(value)` for invalid types. The method for contains accepts any types. This inspection finds situations when you have a list of type A and you are checking for contains on type B which cannot hold.

##### While true

Checks for code that uses a `while(true)` or `do { } while(true)` block.

*Rationale*: This type of code is usually not meant for production as it will not return normally. If you need to loop until interrupted then consider using a flag.
